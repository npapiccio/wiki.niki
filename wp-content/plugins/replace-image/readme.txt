Upload a new version of an image without deleting the old image attachment, so that references to the image remain intact.

== Description ==

The Replace Image plugin adds a button to the Attachment Details screen which allows you to upload or select an image to replace the current image while retaining the URL and attachment ID. This allows you to easily swap in an updated version of an image without having to re-select it in theme settings pages, post/page content, or anywhere else where it might be referenced.

**Important:** Disable your browser's cache and any WordPress caching plugins before use; otherwise, the plugin may appear not to work. See Tools > Replace Image for instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I tried to replace an image but nothing happened. =

Your browser is likely still caching the old image. Try doing a hard refresh (Ctrl + F5 on Windows, Apple + R / Command + R on Mac) while viewing the page on the frontend. Note that the backend seems to retain cached image thumbnails even after a hard refresh.
